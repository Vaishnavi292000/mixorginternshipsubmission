This is my internship selection work which was given to me.
In this you can find 2 php files for working 1 sql file in which I have database and 1 folder called images.
For sql file you just have to import it in you xampp.
For a demo you just have to download this file then save this folder in xampp-> htdocs -> paste the folder
Then start the xampp and write the url on chrome.
